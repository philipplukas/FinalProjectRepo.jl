# Part 2: [your personal project]
Solving PDEs of your choice using Julia on (multi-) GPUs -or- applying some performance optimisation to an exisiting or "bake-off" problem.

## Intro
What's all about. Brief overview about:
- the process
- the equations
- the aims
- ...

## Methods
The methods to be used:
- spatial and temporal discretisation
- solution approach
- hardware
- ...

## Results
